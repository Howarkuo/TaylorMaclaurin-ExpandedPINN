# TaylorMaclaurin-ExpandedPINN

## Augmented PINN with PyTorch

Implement this "Augmented PINN" concept using standard PyTorch. Even without the paper's exact codebase, you can easily implement this "Augmented PINN" concept using standard PyTorch. 

Instead of treating the kinetic rate constant $k$ as a fixed number, you define the coefficients of its Taylor expansion as `nn.Parameter` (trainable variables). The neural network will learn these coefficients at the same time it learns the concentration profiles.

## 1. The Mathematical Connection to Chemical Kinetics

### The Exponential Foundation ($e^x$)
In chemical kinetics, the simplest ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a first-order reaction: 
$$\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k[A]$$

The analytical solution to this ODE is an exponential function: 
$$[A](t) = [A]_0 e^{-kt}$$

This is why $e^x$ is the backbone of modeling concentration profiles over time.

### Taylor Series in the PINN Paper
*"Kinetic parameters are approximated using truncated Taylor series expansions."*

In real chemistry, the rate constant $k$ isn't just a static number; it changes based on external conditions like temperature (often governed by the Arrhenius equation, which also features $e^x$). If the exact physical equation is unknown or too complex, the Augmented PINN uses a Taylor series to approximate how the rate constant $k$ behaves around a reference state.

## The Mathematics: Taylor Series Expansion


The general formula for a Taylor series (specifically a Maclaurin series, which is centered at $x = 0$) for a function $f(x)$ is:
$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 + \dots$$

Here is where your two properties act toghether for the expansion:

* **The Derivative Property ($\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$):** This means that the first derivative, second derivative, third derivative, and every $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ is simply $e^x$. So, $f^{(n)}(x) = e^x$.
* **The Initial Value Property ($e^0 = 1$):** Because we evaluate the derivatives at $x = 0$, every single coefficient numerator becomes $f^{(n)}(0) = e^0 = 1$.

Plugging $1$ into every numerator of the general formula gives us the beautiful, simple series for $e^x$:
$$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \dots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}$$

## Limit Definition of the Exponential Function and mathematical proof

The most common and rigorous way to prove this is by using the natural logarithm and L'Hôpital's rule.

**Theorem:**
$$e^x = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n$$

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Set up the limit and apply the natural logarithm.**
Let $L$ be the value of the limit:
$$L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n$$

Take the natural logarithm ($\ln$) of both sides. Because the natural logarithm is a continuous function, we can pass it inside the limit:
$$\ln(L) = \ln\left( \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n \right)$$
$$\ln(L) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \ln\left( \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n \right)$$

**Step 2: Use logarithm properties to rearrange the expression.**
Using the power rule for logarithms, bring the exponent $n$ down:
$$\ln(L) = \lim_{n \to \infty} n \ln\left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)$$

As $n \to \infty$, this expression evaluates to $\infty \cdot 0$, which is an indeterminate form. To use L'Hôpital's rule, rewrite it as a fraction in the form $\frac{0}{0}$:
$$\ln(L) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\ln\left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)}{\frac{1}{n}}$$

**Step 3: Apply L'Hôpital's Rule.**
Take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator with respect to $n$:

* **Derivative of the numerator** (using the chain rule):
    $$\frac{d}{dn} \ln\left(1 + xn^{-1}\right) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{n}} \cdot \left(-\frac{x}{n^2}\right)$$
* **Derivative of the denominator:**
    $$\frac{d}{dn} (n^{-1}) = -\frac{1}{n^2}$$

Substitute these derivatives back into the limit:
$$\ln(L) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{ \left( \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right) \left( -\frac{x}{n^2} \right) }{ -\frac{1}{n^2} }$$

**Step 4: Simplify and evaluate the limit.**
Cancel the common $-\frac{1}{n^2}$ terms from the numerator and denominator:
$$\ln(L) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right) \cdot x$$
$$\ln(L) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x}{1 + \frac{x}{n}}$$

Now, evaluate the limit as $n$ approaches infinity. The term $\frac{x}{n}$ approaches $0$:
$$\ln(L) = \frac{x}{1 + 0} = x$$

**Step 5: Solve for $L$.**
We have established that $\ln(L) = x$. To find $L$, exponentiate both sides:
$$e^{\ln(L)} = e^x$$
$$L = e^x$$

Substituting $L$ back with our original limit expression, the proof is complete:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n = e^x$$
